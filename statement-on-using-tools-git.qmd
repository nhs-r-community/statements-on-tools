# Statement on using tools - Git and GitHub

Using R (or Python) is just the first step towards data science with the use of Git being item two on the ["baseline fundamentals"](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/#baseline-rap---getting-the-fundamentals-right) level of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP). 
Without the use of Git it is not possible to move to Silver or Gold and with good reason because it is integral to being able to produce analysis and code that is:

- more efficient
- more robust
- more transparent

Much more is written about Git in the [NHS RAP Community of Practice](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/introduction-to-git/) and so this chapter serves to add only a few things to that work.
