# Purpose

This book is a contribution of efforts and experiences from the members of the NHS-R Community - which is more than just NHS and greater than just R - in getting data science tools for their jobs. Very often an analyst or data scientist (or anyone interested in analysis) wants to try to use R or Python, particularly if they are wanting to set up [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/) with a code first approach, but getting access can sometimes be very difficult. 

The NHS is not one organisation and the experiences in getting data science tools varies widely so this is an attempt to bring together those experiences, with suggestions, on how best to approach the issue of access. The difficulties we encounter may well be shared with colleagues from all organisations, not just the NHS, and so we welcome all contributions to this collective knowledge.

# NHS-R Community

This book is being supported by the [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) which was set up in 2018 to promote the use of R in the NHS. As a community we have grown and built up a reputation for openness, sharing and support through training, webinars, conferences and a very active and friendly [Slack group](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/). Whilst the focus was originally on R and the NHS, many members of the community use other tools and come from Local Authorities, Civil Service, Voluntary Sector and Charitable organisations as well as industry. 

## NHS PyCom

We are supporters of the [NHS PyCom](https://nhs-pycom.net/) with people often being on both communities and whilst our coding of choice may differ we have cross overs in data science areas like version control and sharing of code.
